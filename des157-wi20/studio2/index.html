        <p>Romanian author Cioran's aphorisms are some of my favorites!<BR>"Cioran strips the human condition down to its most basic components, birth and death, suggesting that disaster lies not in the prospect of death but in the fact of birth, 'that laughable accident.' In the lucid, aphoristic style that characterizes his work, Cioran writes of time and death, God and religion, suicide and suffering, and the temptation to silence. Through sharp observation and patient contemplation, Cioran cuts to the heart of the human experience."</p>

        <p>This is my iPhone 11 Pro Max! I just bought it and the camera is a game changer. I'm trying to avoid succumbing to facial recognition as a means of providing a password! I tend to stick to Apple products since I prefer their iOS/OS and how seamlessly they integrate.</p>

        <p>This is my MacBook Air! It was a gift I am extremely grateful for, and it has been with me through red eye flights, moving across the country, school, etc. While it may not be ideal of extensive graphic design work with the small screen and trackpad, it still allows me to get a lot of work done and edit photos. It's kind of a little powerhouse.</p>
