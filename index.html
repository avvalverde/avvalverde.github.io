        <h2>
          What is Intersectional Feminism?
        </h2>
        <ol>
          <li>It looks at the intersections between systems of oppression and domination</li>
          <li>Privilege and oppression are not blanket terms or can be solved with a general approach</li>
          <li>Looks at the unique experiences of individuals</li>
          <li>Studies the privileges around gender, race, ethnicity, class, disability, religion, sexuality, etc.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
          How can I be an intersectional feminist ally?
        </h2>

        <p>The barriers faced by a middle class woman living in Melbourne are not the same as those of a queer woman living in rural Fiji.  Women aren’t just exposed to sexism – racism, ableism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia, and religious persecution are intrinsically linked to how diverse women experience inequality.
        <p>As a feminist movement, we need to advocate for the equality of all women – not just those who experience the same barriers as we do.</p>
        <p>To begin to understand the additional degrees of difficulty some women live with, it’s important to look at your own privilege. This can feel like a personal attack, but it isn’t. It’s about noting that your personal history may mean that in some way, you’ve been spared the oppression another woman may have experienced.</p>
        <p>You may not know what it’s like to live as a person with a disability, or have never had to deal with racism. But a woman who has may not have experienced discrimination that you have, like homophobia. Checking your privilege isn’t about creating a sliding scale of who’s worse off – it’s about learning and understanding the views of other feminists, and remembering that we’re all in this together. True equality leaves no one behind.</p>
