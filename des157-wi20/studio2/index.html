        <p>This is my Dr. Bronner's peppermint lip balm. I like to have a lip balm on me all the time, because I really hate having chapped lips. I find this lip balm to be the most moisturizing for my lips, plus the peppermint feels really nice!</p>

        <p>This is my phone. It is an iPhone 7 and I carry it around with me everywhere. I use it for school, work, and watching cute dog videos. This phone has been through a lot because I keep dropping it, but I'm glad it hasn't failed on me yet!</p>

        <p>This is my MacBook Air! It was a gift I am extremely grateful for, and it has been with me through red eye flights, moving across the country, school, etc. While it may not be ideal of extensive graphic design work with the small screen and trackpad, it still allows me to get a lot of work done and edit photos. It's kind of a little powerhouse.</p>
